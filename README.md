StatStar - #  This program is a Python version of the code STATSTAR written in FORTRAN and described in Carroll and Ostlie.  Program has been originally modified and converted to Python in Fall 2010 by Prof. D. Schiminovich at Columbia University for use in C3101 Stellar Structure and Evolution. Here I present my improvements on the code that I use in my Stellar Astrophysics class.
